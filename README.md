Stagebot is a robot designed to be remotely operated for moving set pieces around onstage. It's controlled by bluetooth up to a range of 40 meters, can carry up to 200lbs, and is designed to accomodate rapid set changes. 

The bot can be controlled using a game controller attached to an android phone (see my fork of the AppInventor repository for the modified version needed to accomodate outside input within an AppInventor app). 

The specifications can be found in StagebotFinalSpecs, and a video about the bot can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lmgMIhtahE
